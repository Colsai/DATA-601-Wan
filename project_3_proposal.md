# DATA 601 Wan
## Project 3 Proposal
New York Public Schools
In the third project, I want to think past the question of student performance and look primarily at low-income and poverty indicators.

## Datasets used: (.gov open data)
- 2014/2015: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-School-Quality-Reports-Results-For-High-/vrfr-9k4d
- 2015/2016: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2015-2016-School-Quality-Report-Results-for-High-S/mz5e-yub2
- 2016/2017: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2016-2017-School-Quality-Report-Results-for-High-S/ewhs-k7um
- 2017/2018: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2017-2018-School-Quality-Report-High-School/7c8x-xds8

If I have time... They also have reports from other levels of public schools.

## DATA601 Projects:
- Project 1: EDA analysis on Chicago Public Schools
- Project 2: Analysis on trends within past 4 years comparing charter schools to neighborhood in Chicago Public Schools
- Project 3: Trends in low income/poverty metrics for students in New York Public High Schools 

## Indicators to focus on:
- Temp Housing: Percent of Students in Temporary Housing (metric of student poverty)
- Economic Need Index: A metric that 
- Student Attendance Rate	and Percent of Students Chronically Absent
- Percent of teachers with 3 or more years of experience
- Teacher Attendance Rate

# Background
I thought a lot about a question I wanted to answer. One of the main questions was to look for trends in the Educational system in terms of.
Unfortunately, a lot of these data statistics that I would like are protected (such as NAEP), but I discovered that they *are* listed by the City of New York for their schools. 
Of course, this is a small sample size to deal with, but what I want to do (and merge) is look through High Schools. Particularly, these statistics are important and relevant
due to the recent pandemic- when data from more-recent years is finalized, I would like to go back and compare the

These statistics in the state of New York begi

## Major Questions

### Economic
1. How high and what is the trend of the economic need index (low income/poverty metric)? What is the trend of the temp housing index?
2. For all of the schools in New York, is there a correlation between student attendance rate/chronic absenteeism and economic need/poverty? If so, how strong is the correlation?

### General (and backup)
1. Is teacher attendance rate a good predictor of student attendance rate for High Schools? (is there a correlation?)
2. How does experience correlate with attendance? (Are schools with more 3+ year/experienced educators, more likely to be at schools with higher student attendance?)
