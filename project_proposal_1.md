## Project Proposal for EDA: "Chicago Public Schools: College Scorecard"
Dataset is free, and publically acessible. 

Data Information:
I have chosen the dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/dw27-rash
- Data Name: "Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1819"
- Data Provided by Chicago Public Schools
- last updated November 7, 2019
- Size: 1.8mb / Rows- 654 / Columns - 182

Background:
The educational system has undergone a dramatic change since public schools have been forced to adopt alternative and hybrid models. The Chicago public school system has reopened after a year of at-home education.

Prior to this dramatic change, the Chicago Public School system has played a dramatic and vital community role for many families. With a student body around 400,000, and employing over 21,000 teachers and 37,000 staff members, the Chicago Public Schools are very important to th (1). 

This is a useful dataset because, although it is specific in scope (only focusing on the Chicago Public School system), it includes a larger list of many different metrics that are helpful for review. Larger national datasets often lack the number of metrics that this scorecard has.

Focus:
My general question for focus is: "is education fair in the Chicago Public School system?".
I intend to look at performance metrics, such as graduation rate, NWEA test scores, PSAT/SAT scores, and attendance rates to look at disparities in educational attainment for students- is there a big difference between the best schools and the worst? What are some of the largest disparities in education? Do magnet schools have vastly better performance metrics than other schools?
