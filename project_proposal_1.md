## Project Proposal for EDA: "Chicago Public Schools: College Scorecard"
Dataset is free, and publically acessible. 

### Data Information:
I have chosen the dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/dw27-rash
- Data Name: "Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1819"
- Data Provided by Chicago Public Schools
- last updated November 7, 2019
- Size: 1.8mb / Rows- 654 / Columns - 182

### Background:
In the words of Malcolm X, “Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.” As a country, the United States places great importance on maintaining and improving its educational system. The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) reported that, in 2016, the United States spent 5th most per student in the world (1). However, our educational system has undergone a dramatic change since public schools have been forced to adopt alternative and hybrid models. The Chicago public school system has reopened after a year of at-home education.

Prior to this dramatic change, the Chicago Public School system has played a dramatic and vital community role for many families in Illinois. With a student body around 400,000, and employing over 21,000 teachers and 37,000 staff members, the Chicago Public Schools are very important role for the future (2). It is additionally a large cost burder on the taxpayer in the city of Chicago, with the upcoming school plan budgeting for over $8 billion in expenditures. 

### About the Dataset:
The dataset I will focus on looks at the progress metrics of over 600 schools in the Chicago Public School system for the school year from 2018-2019. This is a useful dataset because, although it is specific in scope (only focusing on the Chicago Public School system), it includes a larger list of many different metrics that are helpful for review. Larger national datasets often lack the number of metrics that this scorecard has, such as individual average scores for tests.

Additionally, future comparisons to this data will be very important. Recent developments in the Chicago Public School system have included changes, such as reallocating funding away from ties to local police departments, as well as possible educational losses and issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Focus:
My general question for focus is: "is education fair in the Chicago Public School system?". How much of a disparity do we see between the best and worst schools? Does every student have a chance at a decent education in Chicago?

I intend to look at performance metrics, such as graduation rate, NWEA test scores, PSAT/SAT scores, and attendance rates to look at disparities in educational attainment for students- is there a big difference between the best schools and the worst? What are some of the largest disparities in education? Do magnet schools have vastly better performance metrics than other schools?
