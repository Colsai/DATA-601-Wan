## Project 2 Proposal "Chicago Public Schools: College Scorecard": Charter vs. Neighborhood Schools and Performance. 
Datasets are free, and publically acessible. 

## Project Notes
Project 1- EDA
Project 2- Analyzing and Answering a Question

### Data Information:
I have chosen the dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/dw27-rash
- Data Name: "Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1819"
- Data Provided by Chicago Public Schools
- last updated November 7, 2019
- Size: 1.8mb / Rows- 654 / Columns - 182

I will also use the datasets for Project 2: 
1. Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1718 (661x163)
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/wkiz-8iya

2. Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1617 (661x163)
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/cp7s-7gxg

3. Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1516 (670x153)
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/fvrx-esxp

### Project 2 Background:
In Project 1, I visualized performance data per school types for High Schools in Chicago.
I looked at the performance differences between school type. Charter Schools and Neighborhood schools are the highest in number.
In this second project, I want to focus more on the changes over a period of time for each of the school types. 

### Project 2 Primary Questions
For Project 2, I want to focus on answering three primary questions:
- Over the past four years, is student performance better (SAT scores, College Graduation Rates, etc.) than at charter schools?
- What are the rates of change for both neighborhood and charter schools in Chicago? Which school type as a better rate of change?
- Are these advantages by schools significant?

### Project 2 Hypotheses  
My hypotheses will be as follows:
1. Chicago charter schools have a small academic advantage over neighborhood public schools in the city of Chicago. 
2. Charter schools have experienced slightly higher rates of improvement/overall change in the past 4 years.
3. While there are small performance advantages in several metrics for charter schools, there will be some metrics in which
neighborhood public schools in Chicago have experienced improved/greater rates of change. 

### About the Dataset:
As with project 1, I will focus on Chicago Public School data that is public. These are SY15-16 thru SY18-19, which I am planning 
to merge and analyze. 

### Things I plan to learn:
- I haven't worked on many projects that merge multiple data sources, so I think that this could be a good opportunity to think about how to merge
different data sources and focus on a few metrics in order to visualize change over time for school performance data.
- Practice with visualizations.
- Summarily answering a question with a 'yes', 'no', or a qualified 'yes- in these ways, no in these-'
- Reflect on issues that come with trying to merge multiple data sources. 

### Focus:
The academics and performance data of charter vs. neighborhood public schools for Chicago Public Schools students.
